	  <h1 id = "bioheading">Jammu Kashmir</h1>
	  <p id = "desc">
	  Kashmir is undoubtedly an enchanting place of visit in Asian sub continent.
	  A remarkable tourist destination with the charm of the hills, snow of winter, 
	  and fruits bearing valley plants, Kashmir valley is a paradise to international
	  tourists. Nestled in the lap of the Himalayas, Kashmir has a rich past with significant 
	  relevance to the present era. History of Kashmir before <em>1947</em> is an insight into Mughal rule 
	  with considerable Muslim invasions and then the colonial rule by the British.

	 <h1 id = "bioheading">Early History Of Kashmir</h1>
	  <p id = "desc">
 On the physical history of Kashmir, it is known to have been a grand lake. After the inclusion to
 the<b> Mughal Empire</b> by King <b>Ashoka</b>, it had the first city with<b> Srinagar</b> in the<em> 250 B.C</em>. Much before 
 the concept of tourism ruled <b>Kashmir valley</b>, it developed as pilgrimage place where monks were laying
 foundation to Buddhism. The religion further gained prominence under the rule of the Kushans. In the 
<b> 7th century India</b>, famous ruler from the Kartoka Dynasty called Lalitaditya built the most famous sun 
 temple, presently a historical and pilgrimage site. Under the Hindu rulers, Kashmir had a tumultuous 
 history until<em> 1003 A.D </em>with the rule of Didda queen ending. The last Hindu ruler of Kashmir was Queen 
 Kota Raniwas until <em> 1339</em>. The Muslim invasion began by<em> 1322</em> and <b>Mirz Haidar </b>constructed the Mughal Empire
 rule in Kashmir only in <em>1540</em>. He was a relative of Humayun and who successfully incorporated Kashmir
 into Mughal territory ruling for at least the next five centuries.

 Sikh community annexed Kashmir under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the year 1820.
 However, after the Treaty of Amrtitsar was enforced in <em>1846</em>, Kashmir was won and ruled by the 
 Dogras from the British. The British gave away Kashmir for<em> Rs 75 lakhs </em>to Ghulab Singh under Dogra rule. They ruled under the British took over the reigns of colonial rule of India.

 Hari Singh became the successor of Partab Sigh and ascended the throne in<em> 1925</em>. With this,
 the rule shifted back to the hands of Hindu rulers of Kashmir. He governed without any other 
 invasions until<em> 1950</em>. A major political party was formed during his rule in the place called 
 the All Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference.

 The territory covering Kashmir was connected to India from Punjab having around 75 per cent of
 Muslims. As the British proposed for two dominions of India and Pakistan, Maharaja Hari Sign 
 refused to go for Pakistan. A ceasefire was eminent when Mountbatten, the last British general
 suggested that he sided with the Indian Territory. . The partition of India and formation of Pakistan 
 agreed with pkistan gaining independence on August 14, 1947.

	  India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947. Kashmir was split as well, with two-thirds going to India and a third going to Pakistan, even though India's share was predominantly Muslim, like Pakistan. Muslims rebelled. India repressed them. War broke out. It wasn't settled until a 1949 cease-fire brokered by the United Nations and a resolution calling for a referendum, or plebiscite, allowing Kashmiris to decide their future for themselves. India has never implemented the resolution.

Instead, India has maintained what amounts to an occupying army in Kashmir, cultivating more resentment from the locals than fertile agricultural products. Modern India's founders, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, both had Kashmiri roots, which partially explains India's attachment to the region. To India, "Kashmir for the Kashmiris" means nothing. Indian leaders' standard line is that Kashmir is "an integral part" of India.

In 1965, India and Pakistan fought their second of three major wars since 1947 over Kashmir. The United States was largely to blame for setting the stage for war.

The cease-fire three weeks later was not substantial beyond a demand that both sides put down their arms and a pledge to send international observers to Kashmir. Pakistan renewed its call for a referendum by Kashmir's mostly Muslim population of 5 million to decide the region's future, in accordance with a 1949 UN resolution. India continued to resist conducting such a plebiscite.

The 1965 war, in sum, settled nothing and merely put off future conflicts. (Read more about the Second Kashmir War.)

	  According to a Congressional Research Service report, "Relations between Pakistan and India remain deadlocked on the issue of Kashmiri sovereignty, and a separatist rebellion has been underway in the region since 1989. Tensions were extremely high in the wake of the Kargil conflict of 1999, when an incursion by Pakistani soldiers led to a bloody six-week-long battle."

Tensions over Kashmir rose dangerously in fall 2001, forcing then-Secretary of State Colin Powell to de-escalate tensions in person. When a bomb exploded in the Indian Jammu and Kashmir state assembly and an armed band assaulted the Indian Parliament in New Delhi later that year, India mobilized 700,000 troops, threatened war, and provoked Pakistan into mobilizing its forces. American intervention compelled then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who had been particularly instrumental in further militarizing Kashmir, provoking the Kargil war there in 1999, and facilitating Islamist terrorism subsequently, in January 2002 vowed to end the presence of terrorist entities on Pakistani soil. He promised to ban and eliminate terrorist organizations, including Jemaah Islamiyah, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. Musharraf's pledges, as always, proved empty. Violence in Kashmir continued. In May 2002, an attack on an Indian army base at Kaluchak killed 34, most of them women and children. The attack again brought Pakistan and India to the brink of war.

Like the Arab-Israeli conflict, the conflict over cashmir remains unresolved. And like the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is the source, and perhaps the key, to peace in regions far greater than the territory in dispute.
