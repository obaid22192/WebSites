	  <h1 id = "bioheading" >XI3 PISTON CONSOLE SET FOR RELEASE ON NOVEMBER 29</h1>



	  <hr />
	  <p id = "desc">
	  

Xi3 Corporation is all set to deliver its Piston Console, revealed earlier this year, on Friday, 
November 29. Yes, that is the day after Thanksgiving, a shopping holiday commonly known in the 
United States as Black Friday. Any prospective buyers that opted to pre-order the console  really, 
it is more of a miniature, modular PC  during or before the SXSW 2013 Gaming Expo earlier this year 
can expect to receive their Piston on or before November 15.
<br />
<br />
The standard Piston sells for $999 ($899 if you pre-order) and packs in an AMD 3.2GHz Trinity processor,
 8GB of DDR3 RAM, a Radeon 7000-series GPU, a 128GB solid-state drive (SSD), and native support for up 
 to three connected monitors. Buyers have the option of spending more for an upgrade to a larger 
 SSD – 256GB for an extra $340 and 512GB for an extr a$750 – and the box is fitted with a second
 drive slot, allowing for up to 1TB of SSD storage, provided you’ve got the money to spend.
<br />
<br />
The real draw of the Piston Console is supposed to be its modular design. The pint sized PC 
is designed for upgradeability, with the process of cracking it open and swapping parts in 
and out streamlined around a form factor that climbs just over 4 inches per side. That said, 
all of this amounts to promises. Xi3 has yet to detail the upgrade process beyond stating that 
it will release specially designed hardware upgrades as new technology becomes available. The
 box is too small to fit most standard parts SSDs notwithstanding  so you will need to rely 
 on Xi3 for upgrades.

It all sounds very nice in theory, but the Piston effectively strips away the chief advantage of 
going with a gaming PC: upgradeability. Xi3 can promise to make new parts available as much as it
 wants, but the fact remains this is a completely new and untested product. Will future upgrade
 options really offer enough variety to satisfy PC gamers that are used to weighing, say a dozen
 or more graphics card options? Will they even be priced competitively, or will the proprietary 
 design fetch a higher price? Then, at the other end of the spectrum, will console fans willingly 
 step up to spend twice (or more) what the upcoming next gen hardware just to get a machine that 
 they will eventually be able to buy upgrades for?
 <br />
<br />

This is the big unknown with the Piston: where exactly does it fall in the consumer landscape? 
The price tag is awfully high for a console gamer to realistically entertain and the hardware 
doesn’t appear  for now  to be flexible enough to satisfy the needs of a longtime PC gamer. 
Valve Softwares recently revealed Steam Machines  which many believed the Piston to be an
 early version of due to an undisclosed Valve investment in Xi3  only complicate the situation.
 We have yet to see the hardware or get a sense of how much it costs, but it would appear that these 
 Steam Machines are in direct competition with the living room-oriented Piston.
 <br />
<br />

What do you think of this thing? Do you typically game on PC or console? Do you think the Piston 
achieves a balance between the two?
