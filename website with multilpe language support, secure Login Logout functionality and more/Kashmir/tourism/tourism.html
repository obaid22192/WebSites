The beauty and tourism potential of the valley has made Kashmir an area of conflict between 
India and Pakistan. A fact which has to be noted is that different parts of Jammu and Kashmir 
are administered by three countries including India, Pakistan and China. The presence of armed
forces around the valley makes it look like a war fortress but deep inside, the valley has beauty,
 unmatched!

<h1 id = "bioheading" >Ladakh</h1>
	  <hr />
	  <p id = "desc">



The Ladakh region is around 3000 meters above sea level and consists of important mountain passes.
 Ladakh, therefore becomes an important trade route connecting Europe and Northern Asia to South-East 
 Asia.

Ladakh is of prime importance to the armed forces as it gives access to almost entire Himalayan region.
 From a tourist’s point of view, Ladakh offers irresistible sights. The Leh and Kargil valleys provide 
 unlimited photographic moments, which would act as perfect souvenirs of the trip to Jammu and Kashmir!
